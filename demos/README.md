# Demos

The demo app for this talk is available in five versions:

* Angular CLI
* React CLI (create-react-app)
* Vue CLI (with single file components)
* Vue (downgraded experience)
* Vue (downgraded experience with components)

## API Server

Each version of the app uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for its test data. To start the API server, just open a terminal into the `/demos/api-server` folder and run `npm start`. Then just keep that process running as you kick the tires on each of versions of the demo app.
